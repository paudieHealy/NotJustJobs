NotJustJobs

We decided to create an application that will allow registered users to look for work in their local area or surrounding areas.
Also registered companies can upload job vacancies to the application for potential employees to view. 
An added feature to this application is a rental section for users to look for property in the area where they are looking for work.

New users will have the option to use a CV template to post their CV on to the application.
The user will also be able to get interview advice, career advice, review companies.

Other options in this application are Salary Calculator, search bar, Sponsors and Employers A to Z.
